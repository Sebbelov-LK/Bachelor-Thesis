This repository, contains the coding required to replicate the result section of the bachelor thesis named Comparative Analysis of HLA Binding Patterns: Tolerogenic Self-Peptides vs. Autoimmune Disease-Associated Epitopes, created in collaboration with Herbert Grunkin. 

The two files are divided up into the full protein analysis R script, spanning half of the result section up until the subsubsection Distribution of proteins over diseases, and the R script for distribution, disease distribution and the rest of the result section.
